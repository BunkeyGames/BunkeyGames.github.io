description: "Flipr is a game all about using gravity to collect orbs, while avoiding difficult obstacles. Little Cubee is hungry for orbs... don't disappoint him! Once you've collected the designated number of orbs for that level, you've beaten the level! There are 48 levels to start, with more coming soon! "

history: "Flipr was born from a prototype that we started a few years back. We picked the prototype back up a few times throughout the years, and only recently in early 2016 decided to make it be our first commercial release. With both of us being 17 years old,  it's a big deal to use to finally have a commercial game releasing."

features:
  - "Rotate gravity in 90 degree increments to collect orbs."
  - "Avoid obstacles such as lasers and spikes."
  - "Complete with 48 awesome levels, with more to come soon!"
