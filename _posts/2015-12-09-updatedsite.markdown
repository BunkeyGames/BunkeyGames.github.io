## New Updates!

If any of you (if there *are* any of you...) remember what the website looked like when I made the "First Post!" post, then you'll notice that we upgraded the "art" of the site, quite a bit! We've got a new logo, new background, AND we're currently in the process of adding new content to the site! (About, Games, Etc.) I know I made the last update in July, and some weird stuff has happened since then, but I'm very happy to say that we are back! Can't wait to see what's in store for Bunkey Games in the new year! :)
